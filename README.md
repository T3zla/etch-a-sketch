# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch built as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum.
This interactive grid lets you draw by hovering over squares, with the added feature of **incremental opacity** — the more you hover over a square, the darker it becomes.

## Features
- **Custom Grid Size** — Choose how many squares per side to create your own drawing canvas.
- **Incremental Opacity** — Each hover over the same square increases its opacity by 10% until fully visible.
- **Reset Functionality** — Clear the canvas and start fresh without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design** — The grid adapts to fit the container while keeping square proportions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity and logic

## How to Use
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/T3zla/etch-a-sketch.git
   ```
2. **Open `index.html`** in your browser.
3. **Draw!** Hover over the grid squares to change their opacity.
4. **Change Grid Size:**
   - Click the reset button.
   - Enter your desired grid size (max 100).
5. **Repeat hovers** over the same square to gradually darken it.

## Learning Goals
This project was built to practice:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Dynamic element creation with JavaScript
- Using variables to track and modify element state
- Applying inline styles dynamically

## Future Improvements
- Add color selection for drawing.
- Implement a rainbow mode for random colors.
- Add an eraser function.
- Allow click-and-drag drawing instead of just hover.
